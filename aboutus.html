     <li> <h2>Company Overview and History</h2>
      <p>Senselet was founded in 2015 by Netherlands-based Veris Investments, which will continue to hold a minority stake. Senselet was founded to improve and develop the potato value chain in Ethiopia. According to the company, more than one million farmers grow potatoes in Ethiopia, but yields are estimated around 20% of the potential. Senselet owns market-leading potato chips brand Sun Chips. These are produced in a factory that was only inaugurated in March 2019. Located in Sheno around 65km northwest of Addis Ababa, it employs around 150 people. Using locally-sourced potatoes, Senselet makes three flavors: habesha spice, paprika, and natural. These are distributed in Addis Ababa and some secondary cities.</p>
